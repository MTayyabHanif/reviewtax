            <span class="SequelSansVFBody-Bold primarydark-text">Reviews.Tax</span> is a free online resource that strives to provide both business and individual taxpayers with company comparisons and free content. Companies cannot pay for a better position as part of our service. However, we may get compensated by a company when you call or request a quote from our website.
        </p>
        <p class="primary-text mt-0">
            As former tax company owners, we use a proprietary algorithm in order to rank our top ten list using factors such as diversity of tax services, average case fees, BBB ratings, customer reviews, years in business, professionals on staff, refund policies, and more.

        <p class="primary-text mt-0">

                                    <span class="SequelSansVFBody-Bold primarydark-text">1) Diversity of Agencies Serviced</span> - It is always a great thing to work with a tax company that handles both IRS and state tax problems. As form tax firm owners, we know many people who run into problems with the IRS also have state tax problems as well.
                                </p>
